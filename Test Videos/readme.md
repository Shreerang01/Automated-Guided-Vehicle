# Prototype Testing Videos

We have prepared a series of five videos showcasing the prototype testing phase of our Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) system. These videos provide an in-depth look at the testing, performance, and capabilities of our AGV prototype in various environments. These demonstrations serve as a visual representation of our progress and highlight the potential applications of our AGV technology in industrial settings. We invite you to watch the videos to gain insights into the development and testing stages of our AGV project.
